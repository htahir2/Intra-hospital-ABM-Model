### Relevance of intra-hospital patient movements for the spread of healthcare-associated infections within hospitals-a mathematical modeling study

#### Description
This repository contains the code that was used for the manuscript "Relevance of intra-hospital patient movements for the spread of healthcare-associated infections within hospitals-a mathematical modeling study" by 
Hannan Tahir, Luis Eduardo López-Cortés, Axel Kola, Dafna Yahav, André Karch, Hanjue Xia, Johannes Horn, Konrad Sakowski, Monika J Piotrowska, Leonard Leibovici, Rafael T Mikolajczyk, Mirjam E Kretzschmar.

#### Manuscript
The accepted version of the manuscript can be found [here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008600).

#### Model code
The model was built by Python (version 3.6) and the library Mesa which is an open source agent-based modelling framework. Other dependencies include Pandas, Matplotlib, NetworkX, Seaborn and Numpy.

#### Hospital data analysis
This directory contains code that was used to analyze hospital data. This is a template script and depending on the data format, appropriate changes are required in order to run the script correctly. Unfortunately, hospital data is not publicly available.
